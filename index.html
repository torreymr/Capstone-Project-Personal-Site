                    My name is Torrey, I'm an aspiring web developer and software engineer. I am currently just over a year out of highschool,
                    and am preparing myself for a coding bootcamp. I am working hard day in and day out, 
                    in hopes of getting an entry level job in the next year!

                    I'm about a year and a half out of graduating high school. Instead of going to college right away like most of my peers,
                    I decided to take a gap year and work in the meantime while I thought about what I wanted to do. I worked at my Grandmas business: A
                    Mexican Style Restaurant, for almost exactly 1 year. While I enjoyed my time there, I knew I wouldn't be able to do that forever, which
                    brings me to my transition into tech!

                    My first time writing a line of code was around 2020. During the lock down, I had a lot of free time on my hands and was looking for 
                    new hobbies and a new career path, considering I was getting closer to graduating high school by the day. With that being said, I haven't
                    been consistent within those 3 years because of school, work, etc. However the time I spent coding built a solid foundation for me, and now I am 
                    taking it very serious and am spending most hours of my day dedicated to breaking into the tech industry and landing that first job.

                        Growing up, I wasn't a big sports fan. I didn't play sports in school and didn't watch them outside of it. Then came UFC 268 near the end of 2021, Usman vs. Covington 2, and since then I haven't missed a night of fights. A lot of things captivate me towards the sport: The build up, the stylistic match ups, the blood shed, the risk and heart it takes, and SO MUCH more.<br> <br>But to go deeper than the sport itself, I think it can be seen as a reflection 
                        of what we call life. We as people get beat up, we suffer, we lose, whether it be physically or mentally. It is our choice to be a fighter, to fight back against the pain, to get back up after we get knocked down, to keep relentlessly moving forward until the final buzzer sounds. In a sense, we are all fighters.

                        I've always been a fan of art and creativity. I am attracted to all types of art: paintings, 
                        music, literature, etc. Even things that may not be considered art, like architecture and even what I'm doing right now, which is web development, I consider art! But my favorite of all is movies. Something about jumbling up sound, cinematography, acting, story, all in one to create a 2 hour, moving, audible, painting, I love! If I would be doing anything else, it would filmmaking.

                        I started drinking coffee heavily about 2 years ago. Before, as a kid I used to love the aesthetic of coffee, but when I tried a cup of pure black coffee, I was greeted with the most disgusting bitter taste I could ever had imagined. Since then I have figured out how I like my coffee (black, but with a tad bit of sugar)
                        and am experimenting with different brewing methods, like a french press, pour over, and want to get an espresso machine in the near future.

                        I've always had a sweet tooth. I've never really cared about the quality of a breakfast or dinner, but when it comes to dessert, I'm very nit picky and want the 
                        best of the best. I'm open to variety and trying everything, but I have to say my favorite is an all chocolate cake. I've only been a taste tester, but hope to start making my own desserts, with the help and guidance of my mom who is a baker!
